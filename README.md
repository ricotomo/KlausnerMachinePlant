# KlausnerMachinePlant

Arduino project to make a plant scream when it needs water. Based on Roald Dahl's Short story "The Sound Machine" where an inventor named Klausner builds a machine that lets plants speak. Here a humidity sensor measures soil moisture and when it becomes to low a screaming sound is played to let me know the plant needs water.
